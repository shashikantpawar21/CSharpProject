Team assigned a task on you to create a console application which is supposed to fetch data from some source and perform processing over received data.

In your response just enlist names of major classes\interfaces with method signatures (including constructors) (C# 8+ syntax). You do NOT have to implement anything.

Desired data source and processing type are passed as parameters to the application.
For example: "myapp.exe --file "C:\myfile.txt" --textReverse"

In first version you need to support:
- Data source - TextFile
- Data source - HttpUrl
- Processing type - WordCount
- Processing type - TextReverse
- Processing type - WhitespaceCount

We need to understand how would you distribute responsibilities between classes, keeping application easy to extend.
There can be any number of data sources and any number of processing types in future versions of your application.
Every time we add new data source and\or processing type - we should not copy-paste similar code (and follow SOLID principles in general).

If you need to clarify something - you may write your questions to: "Sergey.Antoshin@dxc.com".
